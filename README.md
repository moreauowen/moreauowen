## My Experience
ðŸ’¬ I've been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to grow my skills in various SWE internship roles: 
- Datadog, Software Engineer Intern, Aug 2021 - Present
- Tesla, Software Engineer Intern, Jan 2021 - Aug 2021
- IBM, Software Developer Intern, May 2019 - Aug 2019<br>

After my internship offer for 2020 was rescinded, I used my free time do design, develop, and deploy my 
own full stack application in order to learn React and Node.js:
- [RostersGG](http://www.rosters.gg), Sole Developer, May 2020 - September 2020<br>
- Unfortunately I ran out of money to keep this app hosted :(

## Design Thinking, Experiences, and Full Stack
âš¡ My first internship working in QA gave me a unique perspective with design thinking. This blossomed into my love for 
building responsive, well-designed web and mobile applications that provide a *fantastic user experience*.
