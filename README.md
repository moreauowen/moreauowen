## My Experience
ðŸ’¬ I've been fortunate enough to have the opportunity to grow my skills in various SWE internship roles: 
- Tesla, Software Engineer Intern, Jan 2021 - Present
- IBM, Software Developer Intern, May 2019 - August 2019<br>

After my internship offer for 2020 was rescinded, I used my free time do design, develop, and deploy my 
own full stack application in order to learn React and Node.js:

## Design Thinking, Experiences, and Full Stack
âš¡ My first internship working in QA gave me a unique perspective with design thinking. This blossomed into my love for 
building responsive, well-designed web and mobile applications that provide a *fantastic user experience*.
